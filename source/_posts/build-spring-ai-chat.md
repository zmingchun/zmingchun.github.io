## Overview
Crafted on Spring AI framework, this app integrates a Spring Boot backend with a Next.js frontend enhanced by Tailwind CSS styling. It excels at smart, personalized conversations via Spring AI's capabilities, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

## Features
- **Spring AI**: The backend is powered by Spring AI, a cutting-edge AI framework that offers a wide range of AI capabilities.
- **Next.js**: The frontend is built with Next.js, a React-based framework that enables server-side rendering and efficient data fetching.
- **Tailwind CSS**: The frontend is styled with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid and consistent styling.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Spring AI's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) feature allows the app to generate responses based on relevant context from a database.

This application is a perfect example of how Spring AI can be used to build a chat application with smart, personalized conversations.
